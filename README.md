# homebridge-magichome

**A Homebridge plugin for devices running on the Magic Home Wi-Fi system.**

The plugin includes and uses a slightly modified version of [flux_led.py](https://github.com/beville/flux_led).

## Installation

First, install the plugin globally.

````
npm install -g https://github.com/safzal/homebridge-magichome
````

Next, add a new accessory to your Homebridge `config.json`. You can add as many Magic Home-based accessories as you like in the following format:

````
"accessories": [
   {
       "accessory": "MagicHome",
       "name": "LED Strip",
       "ip": "192.168.1.111",
       "setup": "RGBWW",
       "purewhite": false
   }
]
````

The `setup` option is `RGBW` by default which is likely the setting you'll want. Some devices require `RGBWW` or `RGB` to work correctly.

The `purewhite` option should be included for lights with a dedicated white LED. This is likely only the case for bulbs and is therefore set to false by default.
